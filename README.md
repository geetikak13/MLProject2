# MLProject2
Set up a neural network and train it using the provided training data. The feedforward neural network with fully connected layers should have at least two hidden layers. The convolutional neural network should include at least two convolutional layers and two fully connected layers.

# Steps to run
Follow the steps below to execute the code:-
1. Open the folder in VSCode or import all files in folder to a local IDE
2. Open python file "Geetika_MSML_Project2_Final.py"
3. Ensure all packages in import statements are installed
4. Update file paths at the start of main execution section (if required)
5. Open Terminal in VSCode and run the following command - "python Geetika_MSML_Project2_Final.py"
6. The already ran version of the code can be fund in the file - "Geetika_MSML_Project2_Final_Executed_Screenshot.png"
7. Open and read the summary report in the file - "Summary Report.docx"

Note:-
The codes are all labeled and commented for each of the various parts of the project.
